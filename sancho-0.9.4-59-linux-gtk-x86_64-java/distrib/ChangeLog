  * Statistics Tab includes additional tabs with network specific client 
    software/stat tables
     - copy to clipboard retains column layout (tableColumn selector)
     - refresh interval can be set in Prefs->Stats 
     - requires latest mldonkey

2006/07/02:
  * Upgrade to SWT 3.2 final
  * *nix binaries now search for and set MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME env variable
    just like Eclipse (for Webbrowser tab). If it fails you can set your 
    own env variables or disable web tab (see online FAQ).  The gcj binaries
    no longer require a startup script (experimental).
  * Fix some display quirks on OSX
  * Prefs->Display->Console Toggle UnderlineUrls option (might be slow on gtk)
  * Prefs->Transfers->Display file completion percent on chunk graphs option
  
2006/05/28:

  * Fix ampersand display in search tabs [#1464382]
  * LinkRipper supports basic ftp directory lists (doubleClick a dir to cd) [#email]
  * Updated libgcj - local preview over ssh2 connections now works with the gcj builds
  * SWT updates:
    - gtk table columns can shrink thinner than header text
    - gtk table columns with right aligned text should be fixed

2006/04/01:
  * Experimental: SWT supports virtual trees now, so all trees have been made virtual. 
    (downloads tree) They sort & update much faster and alternating tableRow colors are 
    quicker to update (if enabled in prefs->display). 
    (win32 requires XP with manifest for best flicker-free results)
  * Tables: Disabled sort-column colour configuration - SWT now uses the OS's setting
  * Files/clients not reporting chunk availability will have their chunk graphs rendered in
    all black (if chunk graphs are enabled)
  * Sharing strategies added to the share dialog ("+" button in shares tab) [#1427308]
  * Clicking status line when it reports new messages will switch to friends tab [#1431001]
  * Changed Razorback2 web service link

2006/01/23:
  * Fix spawning 'Explorer' button from transfers vew [#1413220]
  
2006/01/19:
  * Fix Percent column sort order [#1410247]
  * Win32 Java version: Writes a "javaw.exe.manifest" file to the directory
    containing javaw.exe if one does not exist (from system path), so that XP 
    uses the XP theme.
    
2006/01/18:
  * Preview->Local download now works properly if mldonkey requires a password 
    [#1409189]
  * Search: support result updating
    - If mldonkey reports X sources for a result but later finds that same result
    on another server with >X sources, it now sends an update for this result  
    (requires latest mldonkey)

2006/01/16:
  * Servers: Add more columns to the server table for ping/version/maxusers/...
    (requires latest mldonkey)

    servers if ED2K-connect_only_preferred_server true [#1406220]

2006/01/05:
  * Add country flag images to all ip address columns 
    - Client table has an added column for the country name (toggleable in 
      TableColumnSelector)
    - requires latest cvs mldonkey, with a valid "geoip_dat" setting

2006/01/02:
  * Add Preview subMenu to shared files -- works by connecting to the web interface 
    preview port (remember to set a preview app in transfers->preview that supports 
    http (ie: vlc))
  * Add File details rt-click menuItem to shared files that have sub files available
  * Add "Download (local)" menuItem to all preview subMenus. This uses the preview 
    function of the mldonkey web interface and saves the bytes to disk (useful 
    if your core is remote).  Set a default download dir in Prefs->Transfers->
    Preview Download directory.  Requires access to the web interface port of 
    mldonkey (or ssh port forward it in the host manager, [gcj bug: gcj compiled 
    binaries don't work when downloading over ssh2 fowarded ports [IOexception]). 
    Download individual files from multiFiles from the FileInfo subfile table.
    (mldonkey seems to send files slower than a normal web server)
    Requires latest mldonkey 
  * Default command line param (no flags) is accepted as a link (-l) to send 
    to the core [#1358506]
  * Add "Search for similar" to download items rt-click menu [#1364482]

    (Workaround SWT bug #56910) [#1387867]

2005/11/12:
  * Add web services menu to shared files rt-click menu [#1349177]
  * FileDetailDialog: Display subfiles table (ie: bittorrent internal files) in
    a tab if available (Preview from rt-click menu in table)
    (requires latest mldonkey) [#1339537]
  * Keyboard shortcuts: Global: CTRL+T load torrents from HD, Console: CTRL+L clear
    screen [#1355609]
  * Miscellaneous

2005/10/23:
  * Add: Drag&Drop .torrent files onto downloads view or link entry [#1333043] 
  * Workaround swt-gtk blank combo bug (bandwidth presets) [#1333126]
  * Prefs->Downloads: Add option to set chunkGraph max length. In the download 
    tree if a file has > X chunks it will squish to X chunks to save time drawing
    the graph (needed for files with many chunks (bt files in particular) which take
    too long to draw) [#1208707]
  * Prefs->General: Add toggle for singleClick or doubleClick to restore/hide 
    from systray [#1336527]
    
2005/10/14:
  * Add: copy links to clipboard with BBCode menu option [#1321465]
  * Keyboard shortcuts to switch tabs: ALT+# or CTRL+# to swith to tab #. 
    ALT+[LEFT ARROW]=left, ALT+[RIGHT ARROW]=right (CTRL+arrows are already 
    used in text input to jump words)  [#1319360]
  * Console: Underline links, launch when clicked
  * Add bandwidth settings submenu to quickly change to another preset

2005/10/04:
  * Preferences: add scrollbars to long pages [#1304604]
  * Downloads: Show files that contain "Fake" in their name/comment in
    a configurable color (toggleable in preferences) [#1204298]
  * Re-enable download arrow for downloading files in search results [#1310729]
  * Option to disable systray icon (Prefs-General) [#1310561]
  * Two column sort [#1250044]
    - If you sort column X, and then sort column Y, any entries
    in column Y that are equal will be ordered by the previously
    sorted column's order (column X).
  * Experimental: SWT supports virtual tables now, so all tables have been made virtual. 
    They sort & update much faster (no delay with 1000 search results), and
    alternating tableRow & sortColumn colors are quicker to update (if enabled).
    - The one exception is the downloads view which is a tree -- SWT doesn't 
    support virtual trees ...yet. 

2005/09/24:
  * Added tooltips to all table column headers 
  * Remove extra quotes in winRegistry link associations [#1274278]
  * Single click on tray icon restores/hides main window [#1300364]

  * Support mldonkey gui proto 34 (2.6.3):
    - Servers with blocked ips appear in red with blocked state
    - Right click->compute_torrent available from shares tab
      (blank tracker uses default in mldonkey, requires bittorent enabled)

2005/08/14:
  * Fix NPE on SSH2 info dialog [#1250687]
  
2005/08/02:  
  * Add Remaining column to downloads table [#1252647]
  * Include: distrib/sancho_no_NO.properties (Norsk)

2005/07/20:
  * Upgrade to SWT 3.1 
    - Support drag&drop table/tree column re-ordering 
    - Support table/tree column sort indicator (toggleable in prefs->display)
    - Tray icon background is transparent on gtk [#1218766]
  * Bandwidth settings dialog (accessible from status line or tray) allows 
    adding/removing/renaming custom entries [#1230686]
    - Entries are saved when you switch to a different one, or press OK. 
    (if you had previously changed the presets you'll have to redo them)
  * Configurable hard kill delay for self-spawned cores (prefs>general) [#1231036]
  * Support mldonkey proto 33: show client donkey software version string [#1235931]

  * Fix chunkgraph display in downloads table [#1208707]
  * Double-click chunk graphs to show/edit color prefs [#1201627]
  * Console toolItem commands (prefs->console) allow multiple commands separated
    by ";"   ex: close_fds;commit;whatever [#1209676]
  * Add optional popup console to status line (far right button on status line)
  
2005/05/22:
  * Use UTF8 strings to communicate with mldonkey -- searching in japanese seems 
    to work but requires a unicode system font to see it, and a unicode font in 
    Prefs->Display->Table font to view the results in the table [#1205541]

2005/05/10:
  * Fix: If started in tray, and close button was mapped to min-to-systray, there 
    might be a strange recursive event loop [#1199196]

2005/05/07:
  * Add options to always start minimized or in systray (if platform has a 
    tray) Prefs->General, or with cmdline params "-min"/"-tray" [#1197449]

2005/05/05:
  * Add relative availability % column to clients table (mlnet patch 3971 
    updates this field more frequently) 
    - updated all .properties files (copied the downloads.avail string)
  * No longer retain all search results once a search is closed (mlnet used to
    require it, but now it seems results can be disposed when a result tab is 
    closed which should save mem if you search a lot)
  * Add F2 hotkey to rename all selected entries in download & server table 
    (popup dialog per entry) [#1195996]

2005/05/03:
  * Include: distrib/sancho_ru_RU.properties (Russian)
  * Fixed another reference holding resource, which didn't release memory 
    properly after a disconnect/reconnect (in eclipse-jface classes)

2005/05/01:
  * Fix crash when searching on a specific network [#1193423]

2005/04/29:

    and taskbar to help distinguish multiple instances [#1192531]
  * Filter out commas from refine filter regexps (exception) [#1192183]

2005/04/25:
  * Support gui protocol 32 (Server->rename)
  * Add: Tools->Screenshot (screen capture the window or desktop and save
    to jpg file)  (doesn't work on FOX)
  * Profiled, and fixed a mem leak when disconnecting/reconnecting, 
    repositioned some threads when searching, and other minor fixes

2005/04/24:
  * Replaced: distrib/sancho_pl_PL.properties (Polish) - This contribution 
    is a new translation from scratch. An ASCII version is available on the 
    downloads page for the FOX version which does not yet support UTF8.
 
2005/04/20:
  * Fix rare NPE on disconnect [#1186425]
  * Added toggle for human-readable byte counts (k/M/G) - disabled
    will display file sizes in bytes (Prefs->Display->General) [#1181822]
  * Added option to copy header bar text to clipboard from rt-clk menus
  * File->(rt-click)->Copy to clipboard now has sig2dat and magnet options 
    (along with ed2k) if the file has these types of hashes
  
2005/04/10:
  * Limit regex filter strings to 1000 chars since RE (gnu regex) doesn't 
    seem to like super long strings [#1178085]
  * Make default mldonkey host "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost" 
  	
2005/03/31:
  * SSH: Add ability to also port forward an HTTP preview port if using 
    the internal mldonkey preview-over-http feature  (Tools->Host manager) 
    [#1174444]
  * Prefs: System paths can contain environment variables enclosed with %'s. 
    Does not work with JVMs at 1.4 level. (gcj/JVM 1.5's work) 
    Bookmarks example: %APPDATA%\Opera\Opera7\profile\Opera6.adr  [#1172540]
  * Add some more bt client software icons

2005/03/28:
  * Read gui protocol 31 (file/shared_file uids) (remotely previewing bt 
    files now seems to work with vlc)

2005/03/26:
  * Fix file extension limitation when choosing a core binary [#1171473]
  * Add preference to specify # of decimals to display in rate & percent 
    download columns: Prefs->Transfers [#1170551]
  * Shortened status text in .properties file by removing "Connected and" 
    from user connection info [#1170010]
  * WebTab: Basic support for reading mozilla bookmarks.html, and opera's 
    opera6.adr in prefs->webBrowser->favorites setting [#1171057]

2005/03/13:
  * Fix rare crash in File Detail dialog [#1162480]
  
2005/03/12:
  * Set scroll page increment on preference pages with scrollbars [#1161946]

2005/03/09:
  * Preview: mldonkey changed temp file name format in 2.5.30 -- sancho now 
    searches the working directory (if set in preferences) for urn_*_[hash] 
    files before falling back to the old filename format ([hash]) when 
    using a local preview app [#1159234]
  * Show file hashes in search result tooltips/details 
  * Download History: Save/restore window size/location
  * Parse network in search results (fuzzy)
  * Display corrupt Gnutella filenames properly
  * WebServices: Rename FileDonkey -> FileHash
  
2005/03/01:
  * Mac: Updated SWT version which should now support tableColumn sorting 
    [#1154679]
  * Add Preferences->All (if connected to a core) to show all core preferences
    in one page, with an option to regex filter the names  [#1152860]

2005/02/22:
  * Restore minimized window when doubleClicking DNDbox [#1145172]

  * Fix NPE when using bandwidth presets without a core connection [#1122086]
  * Add more precision to time columns (#m#s) [#1117227]
  * Use 2 decimal precision in rate column [#1117227]
  * DEL key removes selected search results from results table [#1118838]
  * DNDBox checks to see if it is within screen bounds [#1117632]

2005/02/11:
  * DoubleClick DNDbox restores/hides mainWindow [#1117631]
  * DoubleClick "Disconnected" status text attempts to reconnect [#1120954]
  
2005/02/06:
  * Fix another bug (due to rewrite) in graphs timer
  
2005/02/05:
  * Fix crash on stats tab when using a language other than english 
    (middle of a rewrite .. oops)
    
2005/02/03:
  * Prefs->Search->Save entries can be toggled off to not save search history
    between sessions (in the combo boxes)
  * Search view has 'Clear combos' option in the pulldown menu to clear the search
    history (click the icon, or right click on the "Search" view titlebar) [#1115047]

2005/02/02:
  * Console input line responds to NumPad ENTER key [#1114847]
  * Add "DEL" shortcutKey to tables: DL=Cancel, Servers=Remove, Friends=Remove,
    Clients=Disconnect.  [#1114428]
  * Add simple Find (searchString) popup dialog to Console windows 
    (CTRL-F/rt click menu)  [#1114226]

2005/01/25:
  * Fix OOB exception on some search results [#1109226]
  * Fix SearchTab "Networks" pulldown updating at certain times
  * Reverse order of 'Preview' and 'Rename' in dl rt-clk popup menu 
  * Prefs->Tranfers - Can select operation to perform on file double click 
    (default=Expand branch, other=Preview.  Preview(OS) will try to preview
    with OS default app first, and then try the one you have configured as the 
    default in sancho)  [#1109020]

2005/01/24:
  * Prefs->Search->TooltipsOffset - on by default, maybe this makes tooltips less 
    obtrusive in search results [#1107794]
  * HostManager: Can select to 'ask password' (for mldonkey core) each time you
    connect -- leave pw blank [#1107813]

2005/01/08:
  * Add Razorback2 file stats web service link (downloads/search)
  * Preferences->Display->Transfers->ChunkGraphs can configure colors of the chunk
    graphs [#1092567]
  * Display seconds instead of 0m [#1100473]
  * Fix ArrayOOB [#1091452]
  * File preview: If the OS has a default app associated with the file extension
    it will be added to the list of preview apps.  The "Preview working directory"
    must be set to your mldonkey temp path (since mldonkey can be on a remote
    machine) This directory + file hash becomes the only argument sent to the preview
    app [#1100500]

2004/12/21:
  * WinInstaller: Store path in registry for easier updating to future versions
    [#1088111]
  * Add Clients/Sources2 columns to the download table.  These are numbers reported
    by mldonkey rather than calculated based on what mldonkey sends. (mldonkey is
    not consistent, so everything is optional for you to choose, and these numbers
    are only updated when the full file is refreshed).  The mldonkey gui protocol is
    far from intelligent.  Use the TableColumn selector to re-order/choose columns 
    you want. (see faq)
  * Fix(?): ConcurrentModificationException [#1088882]

2004/12/14:
  * Fix: If using "-c"/"-j" cmdline option it will be preserved when registering 
    links in windows registry [#email]
  * swt-fox: updated swt-fox lib which hopefully fixes resource leak
    
2004/11/24:
  * SSH2: Add support for ~/.ssh/id_dsa & id_rsa if it exists (no password required)
    (see online faq)

2004/11/19:
  * Add batch rename: Select multiple files from the downloads table, Rename->Input
    filename, will cycle through each one allowing you to rename them [#1069640]
    
2004/11/17:
  * Preferences->General->Use most recent host manager settings when sending links
    - If you have multiple hosts in the host manager, and you want to use sancho to
      automatically send links to the core (ie: from a web browser), this will use
      the settings of the most recent host to which you connected when sending links
      ie: Connect to host 1, clicking on links in browser will be sent to host 1
        : Connect to host 3, now clicked links will be sent to host 3.. 
    [#1056976]
  * Fix NPE if CommitingAs or RenamingAs while a file autoCommits
      
2004/11/15:
  * The table column which is currently determining sort order can now be hilighted 
    by a different background color 
    - Preferences->Display->Highlight sorted column  (color configurable)

2004/11/14:
  * Resize tray icon on gnome [#1066131]

2004/11/03:
  * Fix #1059638 (pause a queued file)

2004/10/27:
  * Table default font size didn't update on Downloads/Clients table [#1055399]
    - Prefs->Display->Table font
  * Workaround another libgcj NoSuchElementException [#1049025]
  * Fix popup on download completion hang [#1054402]
  * Preview extensions can be duplicated for multiple choice preview apps [#1051725]
    - Prefs->Transfer->Preview->extensions
    if you have duplicate extensions, like:
    avi=c:\path\zplayer.exe
    avi=c:\another\bsplay.exe
    they will be available to choose from in the dl table's right click preview menu
    
2004/10/20:
  * swt-fox: Added the WebBrowser tab (still being developed by swt-fox..)
    - run with "sancho -b" to disable it if it causes any problems
  * swt-fox: remove weird blue color hardcoding from swt-fox code 
  * convkderc: a small util (on download page) to convert ~/.kderc font and
    color settings and write them to ~/.foxrc/Desktop  
  * Show connection error dialogs in taskbar [#1050602]
  * Make host manager use more intuitive when quitting and selecting
    alternate hosts [#1050605]

2004/10/17:
  * Preferences->Transfers->Resync fileInfos  = 300s (5min) by default
    - Since mldonkey doesn't update fileInfos regularly (it doesn't do a 
    full update when just refreshing the rate/downloaded total) sancho can 
    be set to poll mldonkey & fully resync active files at a certain interval. 
    This updates avail%/chunks which would normally seem 'stuck'. [#1048914]

  * Rewrote chunkgraphs to use less cpu and hopefully have less problems
    (mostly win32/fox)
  * Add 'Update fileInfo' menuItem to rt-click menu in downloads table
    (ex: if mldonkey isn't updating chunksInfo often enough you can manually
    request a resync or ctrl-a to select all and resync them all)

  * Fix ArrayOOB in console [#1007071][#1013491]
  * Preferences->Transfers->Preview
  In addition to specifying an app to use to preview files locally,
  you can also select different apps to spawn based on file extension. The
  main preview app must be filled it -- it becomes the default [#1012362]
  - input an extension and a program and "Add" it to the list
  - select an entry from the list and press "Remove" to remove it
  ie:  mp3 = c:\mp3player\mp3player.exe
       avi = /usr/local/bin/aviplayer
       txt = d:\windows\system32\notepad.exe

  * Include: distrib/sancho_nl_NL.properties (Dutch)
  * diffprop - small util to find missing keys in a translated properties
    file (hopefully this makes it easier to update translations)- available 
    in the translation section of the downloads page (sancho.properties will
    also contain a changeLog on the top in the comments section [#mail req]

    - To toggle tabs to be on the top rather than bottom, right click a tab 
      and choose the menu item 
  	- ie: Servers->Toggle tabs->
  	  "Donkey Connected" Show->Donkey + Connected, with regex "Razor|Proben"
      "FastTrack Connected" Show->FastTrack + connected ...
      "All" Show->all

      "All"
      "Connected clients" Show->Connected*
    - ie: Shares->Toggle tabs->
      "mp3 and ogg files" regex "mp3|ogg"
      "avis" regex "avi"
    * NB: You must Preferences->Servers->Show GNUT/FT to see fasttrack/gnut
      supernodes in the servers table
      
2004/08/10:
  * Servers: Show preferred status column
  * Servers: Right click -> Toggle preferred status (donkey servers only)
  * Support latest mldonkey protocol

2004/08/08:

  * Fix ArrayOOB in column selector
  * Add WebBrowser tab to the Mac binary (it still has bugs due to SWT bugs)
  * Add local/subscribed search option to searches 
  	(whether these work or not are determined by the core)
    2.5.22 has bugs with searches

2004/07/11:
  * Add optional ETA2 column to the downloads table [#email req]
    - Use column selector to enable
    - ETA  = based on current download rate = (remaining / rate)
    - ETA2 = based on past performance = (remaining * age) / downloaded

2004/07/09:
  * Share/Unshare dialog supports drag&drop (plus/minus icon on shares tab)
    - drag multiple directories and drop them on the input line and they will all
      be sent to the core with the currently selected priority (share)

  * Update donkeyfakes URL [#970393]

2004/06/07:
  * Added optional tab categories to the download table [#913455]
  	Usage:   
    - first, click the upper left icon on the downloads table and
      "toggle tabs on" from the menu
    - Add/remove tabs by right clicking on an existing tab and using the popup
  	  context menu
    - Apply filters (in the upper left icon menu (Show->) or type something in
      the refine search regular expression filter) and they will apply 
      exclusively to the active tab
      ex: "Tab 1" Show->Donkey+FastTrack + Audio files with Regex "nas|jay"
          "Videos from Bittorrent" Show->Bittorrent + Video files 
          "My jpg files" Show->Image files with Regex "jpg"
          "All downloads" Show->All
          etc...
    - tabs are on the bottom by default - toggle in preferences->transfers
    - drag and drop tabs to reorder them 
    - with a ton of files, filtering/redrawing is faster with chunk graphs off

2004/05/30:
  * Text change kb/s to KB/s  [#963669]
  * Fix: crash on refine search on gtk (swt) [#962071]

  * Fix a npe/fail to exec runnable 
  * Fix npe in friends tab
  * Workaround gcj-win32 handle leaks
  * fyi: the options "maintain sort order" and "display chunk graphs" are 
    probably the #1 cause of extra cpu load (esp. when dling a lot of files)
   
2004/04/13:
  * Workaround swt-fox frozen updates bug?
  * Fix swt-win32 not runnable/oob bug
  * Fix console clipboard crash?

2004/04/07:
  * Extend spawn core timeout (to account for the slow loading of 
      the blocklist/guarding.p2p)
  * add "-f" cmdline param to force a locale (ie: sancho -f pl_PL)
  * fix cmdline parsing

2004/03/11:
  * Modified the linkEntry (the thing that pops up when the green arrow is 
    pressed) to parse single line torrent URLs #913624
    - this might affect html parsing of pasted data in this area, but the 
    linkripper should probably be used for html ripping
  * Added right click menu for quick access to bandwidth settings from the 
    up/down rate indicators in the status line, and from systray menu #914325  
  * Negate individual refine searches more easily by prepending the string 
    with a "-"   
  
2004/03/07:
  * Preference pages are not hidden in a tree anymore
  * win32 distribution is now a simple installer with uninstall option
  * Added option to use the core's new internal streaming preview URL
    Prefs->Transfers->Preview
    - You can set a local preview app and if you toggle the streaming option on, 
    the first cmdline param will be the http url of the core's stream of the file
    instead of a local filename (if your preview app supports http streams)
    - The settings for the URL are derived from your current core connection, and 
    the http_port of your core settings
    - tested with mplayer.exe on windows (works)
      - set previewExecutable to "c:\mplayer\mplayer.exe"
      - set previewWorkingDirectory to "c:\mplayer"
    - note: seems to fail if you use a password in mldonkey 
      (mplayer bug? mldonkey bug? it fails even from cmdline)
  * If using the "spawn core from within sancho" option, the gui port is now 
    checked to see if it is already open, and if so, doesn't spawn another 
    core but only connects to the existing one (and kills it when closed)
    
2004/03/05:
  * Fix updating of friends list 
  * Modified some .properties strings to allow more complete foreign translations 
    (graph.*/l.downloaded/queued/paused)
  * Add tray support for gtk
  * Fix #910862 (blacklist)
  * Fix #911842 (server remove)
  * started rewriting a bunch of core stuff from scratch (hopefully it still works, 
    please report any anomalies);
  noticable changes:
    Searching:
      "one two three" != (one two three == one and two and three)
      one or two or three == one | two | three
      one -two -three == one andnot two andnot three
      every other search option hopefully works
    + tables are faster
  * Disabled/hid server favorites column until it is implemented in core
  * LinkRipper supports more link types (right click and toggle the option in 
      the context menu to "show all links" if you want) (+suprnova mainpage works)
    - http/ftp links can be sent to core from linkRipper #909928
  * Add small drag&drop box that can be left open on the desktop as a drop target 
    for supported link types (toggle from systray menu, or status line rightClick 
    menu) #909933  
      
2004/03/01:
  * Fix: cmdline -? works again #906528
  * Moved search minAvail processing (faster)
  * Add .torrent file sending support (requires latest mldonkey 2.5.17+)
    - win32: You can now associate torrents with sancho even if your core is 
      on another machine
      (old setting: Preferences->Windows Registry->File associations)
    - all: The torrent folder icon in the link entry header bar now works even
      if your core is not on the same machine as sancho
    - other examples (or associate sancho to file/mime types in browser):
      sancho -l c:\directory\myfile.torrent
      sancho -l /home/dl/myfile.torrent

2004/02/29:
  * Add optional downloads toolItem button to quickly spawn a file explorer 
    and open it to the downloads folder #906372
    - Preferences->Transfers->Explorer to configure the file explorer to spawn 
    and the initial folder to open
  * Add option to save a file history of completed downloads #906475
    - this is a text file stored in the home directory
    - this log can be turned off in Preferences->Transfers->2, 
      and easily viewed as a table in the Tools pulldown menu
  * Ask to retry when core connection denied
  * Fix statusline disappearing networks bug
  * Queued files are not filtered out by default anymore

  * Option to popup a dialog window when a download completes #902582
    - Preferences->Transfers
  
2004/02/22:
  * Search: Add Jigle search tab
    - This tab uses the jigle.com SOAP interface to search the jigle database
    - jigle limits results to 100 at a time 
      - use the Offset field to set a result offset
      - the sort option tells jigle to sort its results when determining 
      which 100 results to return (if > 100), it doesn't change the result
      table sorting
  * Fix some bugs

2004/02/18:
  * Fix statistics crash when using translated .properties #899487

    - requires latest mldonkey (2.5-11)
  * Uploaders table now shows bittorrent clients (latest mldonkey required)
  * Configurable poll delay: Preferences->sancho->Transfers

  * Fix row selection on fox
  * Per row fonts now available on gtk and motif (see 02/06)
  * Added ability to configure language file support:
    - sancho.properties is a "key = value" text file.  It can be renamed and
    translated to other languages (in /distrib dir) (ie: sancho_de_DE.properties) 
    - If you make a translation, send it in and it will be included by default
     (email or submit it as a patch)
    - properties files must be in your $HOME/.sancho/ directory, examples:
      c:\documents and settings\username\.sancho\sancho_en_US.properties
      /home/username/.sancho/sancho_fr_FR.properties
    - WINDOWS: You might have to copy this file to the directory containing
        "sancho.exe" (gcj windows compiler bug)
    Once the file is copied there, you can select it and restart sancho:
    - Preferences->sancho->general->locale (lists available files, blank = none)
    - Naming conventions are from the Java Locale class:
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html  

2004/02/06:
  * Add table alternating row background color support on win32/fox/motif
    (gtk does this automatically when table gridlines are toggled on)
    - Preferences->Display->General
  * Add win32 table row font support (ie: show files > 0 kb/s in a different font)
    - Preferences->Display->Transfers
  * Support mldonkey fileTP protocol (latest mldonkey core required)
    - click the globe+ in the status line to feed the core with http://
    or ftp:// links (mldonkey downloads them) - add mirrors in file details

  * Clients: Request client files from anywhere (right click on client, 
    "Request client files" (clients table/uploaders/etc))
  * Clients: View client files from anywhere (if they are offering files,
    right-click "View client files" (clients table/uploaders/etc))

  * Tools>IRC Client
    - Added a very basic irc client (quick support with mldonkey?)
    "/help" to list cmds, click window close button to disconnect/close 

2004/01/20:
  * Core: Fix bug if hosting core within gui (Prefs>spawn core option)
  * Core: Fix copy to clipboard on the core console
  * Link Entry: Supports local links if your core is on the same
    machine as the gui (c:\dir\file.torrent)
    (this is the thing at the bottom of the gui that is displayed
    when the green arrow is pressed)
  
  * Win32 Preferences: Support .torrent handling in the windows registry
    (Only use it if your gui and core are on the same machine)
  
  * Win32 Browser:
    If you know that a link is a torrent, but it doesn't have a
    torrent extension, hold down CTRL while you click it -- this
    will send it to the core with a .torrent extension and it should
    work from there (ie: http://site.com/redirect.php?hash=234234)
    - tested with the nx01.us site

  * Integrated the web browser on gtk/motif/photon
    - All supported links that you click will be sent to the core 
    for download

    links (ed2k/magnet/etc) that you click will be immediately sent
    to the core for download.  This includes .torrent links!

    - Configure your 'favorites' subdirectory in preferences (click the
    globe to see your favorites menu) (nb: choose a small subdir of favs)
    
    - If you leave the linkRipper open while browsing, it will automatically
    rip the links from the currently displayed page
