This project was originally based upon the code, structure, style and design 
that I wrote that might still be in use in another project (g2gui).   Portions 
originally by others have been removed and written from scratch to make a 
complete cohesive autonomous whole.

Many features are also based upon the Eclipse JFace API which provides a layer
of abstraction to the SWT API.  (EPL, http://www.eclipse.org/)

MLdonkey core is based on the gui protocol specification of the mldonkey 
project. http://www.nongnu.org/mldonkey/
